  abstract = {Object-oriented languages such as Java, Smalltalk, and C++ structure their programs using packages, allowing classes to be organized into named abstractions. Maintainers of large applications need to understand how packages are structured and how they relate to each other, but this task is very complex because packages often have multiple clients and different roles (class container, code ownership...). Cohesion and coupling are still among the most used metrics, because they help identify candidate packages for restructuring; however, they do not help maintainers understand the structure and interrelationships between packages. In this paper, we present the package fingerprint, a 2D visualization of the references made to and from a package. The proposed visualization offers a semantically rich, but compact and zoomable visualization centered on packages. We focus on two views (incoming and outgoing references) that help users understand how the package under analysis is used by the system and how it uses the system.

  abstract = {Object-oriented (OO) software is usually organized into subsystems using the concepts of package or module. Such modular structure helps applications to evolve when facing new requirements. However, studies show that as soft- ware evolves to meet requirements and environment changes, modularization quality degrades. To help maintainers improve the quality of software modularization we have designed and implemented a heuristic search-based approach for automatically optimizing inter-package connectivity (i.e., dependencies). In this paper, we present our approach and its underlying techniques and algorithm. We show through a case study how it enables maintainers to optimize OO package structure of source code. Our optimization approach is based on Simulated Annealing technique.},

  abstract = {To cope with the complexity of large object-oriented software systems, developers organize classes into subsystems using the concepts of module or package. Such modular structure helps software systems to evolve when facing new requirements. The organization of classes into packages and/or subsystems represents the software modularization. the software modularization usually follows interrelationships between classes. Ideally, packages should to be loosely coupled and cohesive to a certain extent. However, Studies show that as
    software evolves to meet requirements and environment changes, the software modularization gradually drifts
    and looses quality. As a consequence, the software modularization must be maintained. It is thus important to
    understand, to assess and to optimize the organization of packages and their relationships.
    Our claim is that the maintenance of large and complex software modularizations needs approaches that help in:
    (1) understanding package shapes and relationships; (2) assessing the quality of a modularization, as well as
    the quality of a single package within a given modularization; (3) optimizing the quality of an existing
    modularization.
    In this thesis, we concentrate on three research fields: software visualizations, metrics and algorithms. At
    first, we define two visualizations that help maintainers: (1) to understand packages structure, usage and
    relationships; (2) to spot patterns; and (3) to identify misplaced classes and structural anomalies. In
    addition to visualizations, we define a suite of metrics that help in assessing the package design quality
    (i.e., package cohesion and coupling). We also define metrics that assess the quality of a collection of
    inter-dependent packages from different view points, such as the degree of package coupling and cycles.
    Finally, we define a search-based algorithm that automatically reduces package coupling and cycles only by
    moving classes over existing packages. Our optimization approach takes explicitly into account the original
    class organization and package structure. It also allows maintainers to control the optimization process by
    specifying: (1) the maximal number of classes that may change their packages; (2) the classes that are
    candidate for moving and the classes that should not; (3) the packages that are candidate for restructuring
    and the packages that should not; and (4) the maximal number of classes that a given package can entail.
    The approaches presented in this thesis have been applied to real large object-oriented software systems. The
    results we obtained demonstrate the usefulness of our visualizations and metrics; and the effectiveness of our
    optimization algorithm.},

  abstract = {Context: Object-oriented languages such as Java, Smalltalk, and C++ structure their programs using packages. Maintainers of large systems need to understand how packages relate to each other, but this task is complex because packages often have multiple clients and play different roles (class container, code ownership. . . ). Several approaches have been proposed, among which the use of cohesion and coupling metrics. Such metrics help identify candidate packages for restructuring; however, they do not help maintainers actually understand the structure and interrelation- ships between packages.
Objectives: In this paper, we use pre-attentive processing as the basis for package visualization and see to what extent it could be used in package understanding.
Method: We present the package fingerprint, a 2D visualization of the references made to and from a package. The proposed visualization offers a semantically rich, but compact and zoomable views centered on packages. We focus on two views (incoming and outgoing references) that help users understand how the package under analysis is used by the system and how it uses the system.
Results: We applied these views on four large systems: Squeak, JBoss, Azureus, and ArgoUML. We obtained several interesting results, among which, the identification of a set of recurring visual patterns that help maintainers: (a) more easily identify the role of and the way a package is used within the system (e.g., the package under analysis provides a set of layered services), and, (b) detect either problematic situations (e.g., a single package that groups together a large number of basic services) or opportunities for better package restructuring (e.g., removing cyclic dependencies among packages). The visualization generally scaled well and the detection of different patterns was always possible.
Conclusion: The proposed visualizations and patterns proved to be useful in understanding and maintaining the different systems we addressed. To generalize to other contexts and systems, a real user study is required.},

  abstract = {Designing class models is usually an iterative process to detect how to express, for a specific domain, the adequate concepts and their relationships. During those iterations, the abstraction of concepts and relationships is an important step. In this paper, we propose to automate this abstraction process using techniques based on Formal Concept Analysis in a model-driven context. Using UML 2.0 class diagrams as modeling language for class models, in this proposal we show how our model-driven approach enables parameterization, tracing and generalization to any metamodel to express class models.},

  abstract = {Supporting read-only and side effect free execution has been the focus of a large body of work in the area of statically typed programming languages. Read-onlyness in dynamically typed languages is difficult to achieve because of the absence of a type checking phase and the support of an open-world assumption in which code can be constantly added and modified. To address this issue, we propose Dynamic Read-Only references (DRO) that provide a view on an object where this object and its object graph are protected from modification. The read- only view dynamically propagates to aggregated objects, without changing the object graph itself; it acts as a read-only view of complex data structures, without making them read-only globally. We implement dynamic read-only references by using smart object proxies that lazily propagate the read-only view, following the object graph and driven by control flow and applied them to realize side-effect free assertions.},

Refactoring to eliminate these anomalies may not be an option, at least in certain stages of software evolution.  Classboxes are modules that restrict the visibility of changes to selected clients only, thereby offering more freedom in the way unanticipated changes may be implemented, and thus reducing the need for convoluted design anomalies. In this paper we demonstrate how classboxes can be implemented in statically-typed languages like {Java}. We also present an extended case study of Swing, a {Java} GUI package built on top of AWT, and we document the ensuing anomalies that Swing introduces. We show how Classbox/J, a prototype implementation of classboxes for {Java}, is used to provide a cleaner implementation of Swing using local refinement rather than subclassing.},

mechanisms to bundle interacting classes (i.e., packages, modules, selector namespaces,

direction has been realized. In this paper we present a simple module calculus together

support the reuse of method collections over several classes. However, traits cannot be

are a new module system that supports the local redefinition of classes: a collection of
classes can be locally extended with variables and/or methods and the existing clients do
not get impacted by changes. However, an extension applied to a class by a classbox cannot
be reused for other classes. This paper describes how combining Traits and Classboxes
supports the safe introduction of crosscutting collaborations: safe because the existing
clients of the classes do not get impacted, crosscutting because collaborations between
several classes can be put in place in a unanticipated manner. In the resulting system, a
collaboration is represented by a classbox and a role by a trait.},

extension and instance variable addition. Class extensions and definitions defined in a

  abstract = {Traits offer a fine-grained mechanism to compose classes from reusable
components while avoiding problems of fragility brought by multiple inheritance and mixins.
Traits as originally proposed are \emph{stateless}, that is, they contain only methods, but
no instance variables. State can only be accessed within traits by accessors, which become
\emph{required methods} of the trait. Although this approach works reasonably well in
practice, it means that many traits, viewed as software components, are artificially
\emph{incomplete}, and classes that use such traits may contain significant amounts of
boilerplate glue code. Although these limitations are largely mitigated by proper tool
support, we seek a cleaner solution that supports \emph{stateful traits}. The key
difficulty is how to handle conflicts that arise when composed traits contribute instance
variables whose names clash. We present a solution that is faithful to the guiding
principle of stateless traits: \emph{the client retains control of the composition}.
Stateful traits consist of a minimal extension to stateless traits in which instance
variables are purely local to the scope of a trait, unless they are explicitly made
accessible by the composing client of a trait. Naming conflicts are avoided, and variables
of disjoint traits can be explicitly merged by clients. We discuss and compare two
implementation strategies, and briefly present a case study in which stateful traits have
been used to refactor the trait-based version of the Smalltalk collection hierarchy.},

While the default tools are adequate for browsing the code and developing applications, it is often cumbersome to extend the environment to support new language constructs or to build additional tools supporting new ways of navigating and presenting source code. In this paper, we present the OmniBrowser, a browser framework that supports the definition of browsers based on an explicit metamodel. With OmniBrowser a domain model is described in a graph and the navigation in this graph is specified in its associated metagraph. We present how new browsers are built from predefined parts and how new tools are easily described. The browser framework is implemented in the Squeak Smalltalk environment. This paper shows several concrete instantiations of the framework: a remake of the ubiquitous Smalltalk System Browser, and a coverage browser.},

  abstract = {Following last two years' workshop on dynamic languages at the ECOOP
conference, the Dyla 2007 workshop was a successful and popular event. As its name implies,
the workshop's focus was on dynamic languages and their applications. Topics and
discussions at the workshop included macro expansion mechanisms, extension of the method
lookup algorithm, language interpretation, reflexivity and languages for mobile ad hoc
networks. The main goal of this workshop was to bring together different dynamic language
communities and favouring cross communities interaction. Dyla 2007 was organised as a full
day meeting, partly devoted to presentation of submitted position papers and partly devoted
to tool demonstration. All accepted papers can be downloaded from the workshop's web site.
In this report, we provide an overview of the presentations and a summary of discussions.},

  abstract = {Smalltalk is not only an object-oriented programming language; it is also
known for its extensive integrated development environment supporting interactive and
dynamic programming. While the default tools are adequate for browsing the code and
developing applications, it is often cumbersome to extend the environment to support new
language constructs or to build additional tools supporting new ways of navigating and
presenting source code. In this paper, we present the OmniBrowser, a browser framework that
supports the definition of browsers based on an explicit metamodel. With OmniBrowser a
domain model is described in a graph and the navigation in this graph is specified in its
associated metagraph. We present how new browsers are built from predefined parts and how
new tools are easily described. The browser framework is implemented in the Squeak
Smalltalk environment. This paper shows several concrete instantiations of the framework: a
remake of the ubiquitous Smalltalk System Browser, a coverage browser, the Duo Browser and
the Dynamic Protocols browser.},

@article{Berg08e,
  abstract = {Traits offer a fine-grained mechanism to compose classes from reusable components while avoiding problems of fragility brought by multiple inheritance and mixins. Traits as originally proposed are stateless, that is, they contain only methods, but no instance variables. State can only be accessed within stateless traits by accessors, which become required methods of the trait. Although this approach works reasonably well in practice, it means that many traits, viewed as software components, are artificially \emph{incomplete}, and classes that use such traits may contain significant amounts of boilerplate glue code. We present an approach to stateful traits that is faithful to the guiding principle of stateless traits: the client retains control of the composition. Stateful traits consist of a minimal extension to stateless traits in which instance variables are purely local to the scope of a trait, unless they are explicitly made accessible by the composing client of a trait. We demonstrate by means of a formal object calculus that adding state to traits preserves the flattening property: traits contained in a program can be compiled away. We discuss and compare two implementation strategies, and briefly present a case study in which stateful traits have been used to refactor the trait-based version of the Smalltalk collection hierarchy.},

Moreover, the metaphor of message sending and the anthropomorphism promoted by object-oriented languages makes it difficult to statically identify the precise role the objects play at run-time. We propose a lightweight visualization approach enriched with run-time information which allows us to identify precise aspects of the objects lifetime such as the role played in the creation of other objects and the communication architecture they support. Our approach not only supports the run-time understanding of an application but also allows one to evaluate test understanding and test coverage.},

  abstract = {In this dissertation, we present Procedural Object-Oriented Code (POC). POC is the aftermath of the software development activity that involves state of the art object-oriented languages, without employing object-oriented analysis and design. Huge classes, absence of abstractions for domain entities, and shallow inheritance hierarchies are hallmark design defects of procedural object-oriented code. POC also consists of scattered code appearing not only due to the absence of aspects, but it also manifests scattered code appearing due to the non-abstracted domain entities i.e., domain entities that do not have their proper object-oriented classes. The non-abstracted domain logic hinders mining useful crosscutting concerns related to aspects in POC. Confronted with the absence of object-oriented design and the difficulty of mining aspects in POC, we studied it from two perspectives.
	First, we improve aspect mining techniques by classifying various crosscutting concerns identified in POC with a two-pronged approach: Firstly, the approach identifies and groups crosscutting concerns present in a software system: aspects as well as non-abstracted domain logic. Crosscutting concerns pertaining to non- abstracted domain entities are identified and extracted through their usage of application domain entity data. Secondly, a new metric called spread-out is introduced to quantify the divulgence of diverse crosscutting concerns.
	Second, we studied the problem of object identification in procedural object- oriented code. We present a semi-automatic, tool-assisted approach for restructuring POC into an improved object-oriented design. The approach identifies principal classes in POC. These principal classes are then used to extract object-oriented abstractions using Formal Concept Analysis lattices. This is achieved by providing three different concept lattices, namely fundamental, association, and interactions views.
	We developed tools to validate the approaches presented in the thesis. The approaches are validated on a recently developed industrial application. The application is used to run blood plasma analysis automatons. The results of our approach are promising.},

  abstract = {A trait is a programming construct which provides code reusability. Traits are groups of methods that can be reused orthogonally from inheritance. Traits offer a solution to the problems of multiple inheritance by providing a behavior-centric modularity. Since traits offer an alternative to traditional inheritance-based code reuse, a couple of questions arise. For example, what is a good granularity for a Trait enabling reuse as well as plug ease? How much reuse can we expect on large existing inheritance-based hierarchies?
In this paper we take as case study the Smalltalk Collection hierarchy and we start rewriting it from scratch using traits from the beginning. We show how such library can be built using traits and we report such a preliminary experience. Since the Collection library is large, we focused and built the main classes of the library with Traits and report problems we encountered and how we solved them. Results of this experience are positive and show that we can build new collections based on the traits used to define the new library kernel.},

This trend results in largely difficult to understand, difficult to extend and unmaintainable systems. As new general techniques for virtual machines arise, it gets harder to incorporate or test these techniques because of early design and optimization decisions. In this paper we show how such decisions can be postponed to later phases by separating virtual machine implementation issues from the high-level machine-specific model. We construct compact models of whole-system VMs in a high-level language, which exclude all low-level implementation details. We use the pluggable translation toolchain PyPy to translate those models to executables. During the translation process, the toolchain reintroduces the VM implementation and optimization details for specific target platforms.  As a case study we implement an executable model of a hardware gaming device. We show that our approach to VM building increases understandability, maintainability and extendability while preserving performance.},

To evaluate the expressiveness of traits, some hierarchies were refactored, showing code reuse.

This paper presents our work on designing and implementing a new trait-based stream library named Nile. It evaluates how far traits enable reuse, what problems can be encountered when building a library using traits from scratch and compares the traits solution to alternative composition mechanisms. Nile's core allows the definition of compact collection and file streaming libraries as well as the implementation of a backward-compatible new stream library. Nile method size shows a reduction of 40% compared to the Squeak equivalent. The possibility to reuse the same set of traits to implement two distinct libraries is a concrete illustration of trait reuse capability.},

  abstract = {Although coordination of concurrent objects is a fundamental as-pect of object-oriented concurrent programming, there is only little support for its specification and abstraction at the language level.  This is a problem because coordination is often buried in the code of the coordinated objects, leading to a lack of abstraction and reuse. Here we present CoLaS, a coordination model and its implementation based on the notion of Coordination Groups. By clearly identifying and separating the coordination from the co-ordinated objects CoLaS provides a better abstraction and reuse of the coordination and the coordinated objects. Moreover CoLaS's high dynamicity provides better support for coordination of active objects.},

  abstract = {Open Distributed Systems are the dominating intellectual issue of the end of this century.  Figuring out how to build those systems will become a central issue in distributed system research in the next future. Although CORBA seems to provide all the necessary support to construct those systems. It provides a very limited support to the evolution of requirements in those systems. The main problem is that the description of the elements from which systems are built, and the way in which they are composed are mixed into the application code. Making them difficult to understand, modify and customize.  We think that a solution to this problem goes through the introduction of the so called coordination models and languages into the CORBA model. We propose in this paper the introduction of our object coordination model called CoLaS into the CORBA model.},

  abstract = {Traits are reusable building blocks that can be composed to share methods across unrelated class hierarchies. Original traits are stateless and cannot express visibility control for methods. Two extensions, stateful traits and freezable traits, have been proposed to overcome these limitations. However, these extensions introduce complexity and have not yet been combined to simultaneously add both state and visibility control to traits.
This paper revisits the addition of state and visibility control to traits. Rather than extending the original traits model with additional operations, we allow traits to be lexically nested within other modules. Traits can then have (shared) state and visibility control by hiding variables or methods in their lexical scope. Although the Traits' flattening property has to be revisited, the combination of traits with lexical nesting results in a simple and expressive trait model. We discuss an implementation of the model in AmbientTalk and specify its operational semantics.},

  abstract = {Reverse engineering is the process of uncovering the design and the design rationale from a functioning software system. Reverse engineering is an integral part of any successful software system, because changing requirements lead to implementations that drift from their original design. In contrast to traditional reverse engineering techniques -which analyse a single snapshot of a system- we focus the reverse engineering effort by determining where the implementation has changed. Since changes of object-oriented software are often phrased in terms of refactorings, we propose a set of heuristics for detecting refactorings by applying lightweight, object-oriented metrics to successive versions of a software system. We validate our approach with three separate case studies of mature object-oriented software systems for which multiple versions are available. The case studies suggest that the heuristics support the reverse engineering process by focusing attention on the relevant parts of a software system.},

The industrial partners in the FAMOOS project have learned this lesson the hard way: they are now faced with large and rigid software systems that hamper them in meeting a diverse and evolving set of customer requirements. Object-oriented frameworks are touted as a promising solution, but it is unclear how to transform object-oriented legacy systems into frameworks.

We propose a single, compact view of all class hierarchies at once using a custom Sunburst layout. It enables to quickly discover interesting facts across classes while preserving the essential relationship between parent and children classes. We explain how standard inheritance metrics are mapped into our visualization. Additionally, we define a new metric characterizing similar children classes. Using these metrics and the proposed layout, a set of common visual patterns is derived.  These patterns allow the programmer to quickly understand how inheritance is used and provide answers to some essential questions when performing program comprehension tasks. Our approach is evaluated through a case study that involves examples from large programs, demonstrating its scalability.}

In this context, concerns about meta-modeling and analysis techniques need to be augmented by technical concerns about how to reuse and how to build upon the efforts of previous research. MOOSE is an extensive infrastructure for reverse engineering evolved for over 10 years that promotes the reuse of engineering efforts in research. MOOSE accommodates various types of data modeled in the FAMIX family of meta-models. The goal of this half-day workshop is to strengthen the community of researchers and practitioners who are working in re- and reverse engineering, by providing a forum for building future research starting from MOOSE and FAMIX as shared infrastructure.}

  abstract = {The developers of tools for dynamic analysis are faced with choosing from the many approaches to gathering runtime data. Typically, dynamic analysis involves instrumenting the program under investigation to record its runtime behavior.  Current approaches for byte-code based systems like Java and Smalltalk rely often on inserting byte-code into the program under analysis. However, detailed knowledge of the target programming language or virtual machine is required to implement dynamic analysis tools. Obtaining and exploiting this knowledge to build better analysis tools is cumbersome and often distracts the tool builder from the actual goal, which is the analysis of the runtime behavior of a system. In this paper, we argue that we need to adopt a higher level view of a software system when considering the task of abstracting runtime information. We focus on object-oriented virtual machine based languages. We want to be able to deal with the runtime system as a collection of reified first-class entities. We propose to achieve this by introducing a layer of abstraction, i.e., a behavioral middle layer. This has the advantage that the task of collecting dynamic information is not concerned with low level details of a specific language or virtual machine.  The positive effect of such a behavioral middle layer is twofold: on the one hand it provides us with a standard API for all dynamic analysis based tools to use, on the other hand it allows the tool developer to abstract from the actual implementation technique.},

In this paper we present Persephone, an efficient implementation of a sub-method meta-object protocol (MOP) based on AST annotations and dual methods (a compiled method and its meta-object) that reconcile AST expressiveness with bytecode execution. We validate the MOP by presenting TreeNurse, a method instrumentation framework and TypePlug, an optional, pluggable type system which is based on Persephone.},

  abstract = {Real world software systems change continuously to meet new demands. Most programming languages and development environments, however, are more concerned with limiting the effects of change rather than enabling and exploiting change. Various techniques and technologies to exploit change have been developed over the years, but there exists no common support for these approaches. We propose Changeboxes as a general-purpose mechanism for encapsulating change as a first-class entity in a running software system. Changeboxes support multiple, concurrent and possibly inconsistent views of software artifacts within the same running system.  Since Changeboxes are first-class, they can be manipulated to control the scope of change in a running system.Furthermore, Changeboxes capture the semantics of change. Changeboxes can be used, for example, to encapsulate refactorings, or to replay or analyze the history of changes. In this paper we introduce Changeboxes by means of a prototype implementation. We illustrate the benefits that Changeboxes offer for evolving software systems, and we present the results of a preliminary performance evaluation that assesses the costs associated with Changeboxes while suggesting possible strategies for improvement.},

  abstract = {Computational reflection is a fundamental mechanism in object oriented languages. Reflection has proved useful in many contexts, such as in the design of development environments, language extension, and the dynamic, unanticipated adaptation of running systems We identify three problems with the current approach to reflection in object oriented languages: partial behavioral reflection needs to be anticipated, structural reflection is limited to the granularity of a method, and behavioral reflection cannot be applied to the whole system. To address these problems, we extend structural reflection to cover sub-method elements and present how sub-method structural reflection supports unanticipated partial behavioral reflection. We add the concept of context to represent meta-level execution and show how this allows behavioral reflection to be applied even to system classes. We describe an implementation in Smalltalk. Benchmarks validate the practicability of our approach. In addition, we present an experimental evaluation in which we show how the system is used for dynamic analysis. We realize dynamic feature analysis by annotating the sub-method structure of the system directly to denote features instead of recording full execution traces.},

  abstract = {Behavioral reflection is crucial to support for example functional upgrades, on-the-fly debugging, or monitoring critical applications. However the use of reflective features can lead to severe problems due to infinite metacall recursion even in simple cases. This is especially a problem when reflecting on core language features since there is a high chance that such features are used to implement the reflective behavior itself. In this paper we analyze the problem of infinite meta-object call recursion and solve it by providing a first class representation of meta-level execution: at any point in the execution of a system it can be determined if we are operating on a meta-level or base level so that we can prevent infinite recursion. We present how meta-level execution can be represented by a meta-context and how reflection becomes context-aware. Our solution makes it possible to freely apply behavioral reflection even on system classes: the meta-context brings stability to behavioral reflection. We validate the concept with a robust implementation and we present benchmarks.},

  abstract = {A feature represents a functional requirement fulfilled by a system. Since many maintenance tasks are expressed in terms of features, it is important to establish the correspondence between a feature and its implementation in source code.  Traditional approaches to establish this correspondence exercise features to generate a trace of runtime events, which is then processed by post-mortem analysis.  These approaches typically generate large amounts of data to analyze. Due to their static nature, these approaches do not support incremental and interactive analysis of features. We propose a radically different approach called live feature analysis, which provides a model at runtime of features. Our approach analyzes features on a running system and also makes it possible to grow feature representations by exercising different scenarios of the same feature, and identifies execution elements even to the sub-method level.  We describe how live feature analysis is implemented effectively by annotating structural representations of code based on abstract syntax trees. We illustrate our live analysis with a case study where we achieve a more complete feature representation by exercising and merging variants of feature behavior and demonstrate the efficiency or our technique with benchmarks.},

The reengineering of those systems often poses problems because of the considerable size and complexity of such systems. In the context of the FAMOOS project we have developed a language independent environment called Moose which can deal with that complexity. This paper describes the architecture of Moose, the tools which have been developed around it and the industrial experiences we have obtained.},

  abstract = {Tuple spaces have turned out to be one of the most fundamental abstractions for coordinating communicating agents. At the same time, researchers continue to propose new variants of tuple spaces, since no one approach seems to be universally applicable to all problem domains. Some models offer a certain configurability, but existing approaches generally stop at afixed set of configuration options and static configuration at instantiation time. We argue that a more open approach is needed, and present OpenSpaces, an object-oriented framework that supports static configurability through subclassing across several dimensions, as well as dynamic configurability of policies through runtime composition. We introduce OpenSpaces by showing how it can be used to instantiate a typical application, and we present an overview of the framework, implemented in Smalltalk, detailing the various degrees of configurability.},

We show that all the cultural aspects of Smalltalk, i.e., the vocabulary and the syntax support the object metaphor. In addition, we stress that the programming environment should also support the metaphor. We show that Smalltalk environments offer an important property we named liveness or object proximity that promotes the anthropomorphic perception of objects. By providing excerpt from our forth coming book, we show how Squeak with the Morphic framework reinforces this ability to make object into living entities.},

Current approaches extract and use information from the complete execution trace of a system. The sheer size and complexity of such traces make their handling, storage, and analysis difficult. Current software systems which run almost non-stop do not permit such a full analysis. In this paper we present a lightweight approach based on the extraction of a condensed amount of information, e.g., measurements, that does not require a full trace. Using this condensed information, we propose a visualization approach which allows us to identify and understand certain aspects of the objects' lifetime such as their role played in the creation of other objects and the communication architecture they support.},

  abstract = {Due to the size and the extreme complexity of legacy systems, it is nearly impossible to write from scratch tests before refactoring them. In addition object-oriented legacy systems present specific requirements to test them. Indeed late-binding allow subclasses to change fundamental aspects of the superclass code and in particular call flows.  Moreover Object-oriented programming promotes a distribution of the responsibilities to multiple entities leading to complex scenario to be tested.  In such a context one of the few trustable source of information is the execution of the application itself. Traditional forward engineering approaches such as unit testing do not really provide adequate solution to this problem. Therefore there is a need for a more expressive way of testing the execution of object-oriented applications. We propose to represent the trace of object-oriented applications as logic facts and express tests over the trace.  This way complex sequences of message exchanges, sequence matching, or expression of negative information are expressed in compact form. We validated our approach by implementing TestLog a prototype tool and testing the Moose reengineering environment and a meta-interpreter.},

  abstract = {Developing web applications is difficult since (1) the client-server relationship is asymmetric: the server cannot update clients but only responds to client requests and (2) the navigation facilities of web browsers lead to a situation where servers cannot control the state of the clients.  Page-centric web application frameworks fail to offer adequate solutions to model control flow at a high-level of abstraction. Developers have to work manually around the shortcomings of the HTTP protocol. Some approaches offer better abstractions by composing an application out of components, however they still fail to offer modeling control flow at a high level. Continuation-based approaches solve this problem by providing the facilities to model a control flow over several pages with one piece of code. However combining multiple flows inside the same page is difficult. This article presents Seaside. Seaside is a framework which combines an object-oriented approach with a continuation-based one. A Seaside application is built out of components (i.e., objects) and the logic of the application benefits from the continuation-based program flow infrastructure.  Seaside offers a unique way to have multiple control flows on a page, one for each component. This enables the developer to write components that are highly reusable and that can be used to compose complex web applications with higher quality in less time.},

  abstract = {Understanding source code is an important task in the maintenance of software systems. Legacy systems are not only limited to procedural languages, but are also written in object-oriented languages. In such a context, understanding classes is a key activity as they are the cornerstone of the object-oriented paradigm and the primary abstraction from which applications are built. Such an understanding is however difficult to obtain because of reasons such as the presence of late binding and inheritance. A first level of class understanding consists of the understanding of its overall structure, the control flow among its methods, and the accesses on its attributes. We propose a novel xvisualization of classes called class blueprint that is based on a semantically enriched visualization of the internal structure of classes. This visualization allows a software engineer to build a first mental model of a class that he validates via opportunistic code-reading. Furthermore, we have identified visual patterns that represent recurrent situations and as such convey additional information to the viewer. The contributions of this article are the class blueprint, a novel visualization of the internal structure of classes, the identification of visual patterns, and the definition of a vocabulary based on these visual patterns. We have performed several case studies of which one is presented in depth, and validated the usefulness of the approach in a controlled experiment.},

  abstract = {In pure object-oriented languages, classes are objects, instances of other classes called metaclasses. In the same way as classes define the properties of their instances, metaclasses define the properties of classes. It is therefore very natural to wish to reuse class properties, utilizing them amongst several classes. However this introduced metaclass composition problems, i.e., code fragments applied to one class may break when used on another class due to the inheritance relationship between their respective metaclasses.  Numerous approaches have tried to solve metaclass composition problems, but they always resort to an ad-hoc manner of handling conflicting properties, alienating the meta-programmer. We propose a uniform approach that represents class properties as traits, groups of methods that act as a unit of reuse from which classes are composed. Like all the other classes in the system, metaclasses are composed out of traits. This solution supports the reuse of class properties, and their safe and automatic composition based on explicit conflict resolution. The paper discusses traits and our solution, shows concrete examples implemented in the Smalltalk environment Squeak, and compares our approach with existing models for composing class properties.},

Ideally if a legacy system is covered by tests, running the tests on the new version can identify potential differences or discrepancies. However, writing tests for an unknown and large system is difficult due to the lack of internal knowledge. It is especially difficult to bring the system to an appropriate state. Our solution is based on the acknowledgment that one of the few trustable piece of information available when approaching a legacy system is the running system itself. Our approach reifies the execution traces and uses logic programming to express tests on them. Thereby it eliminates the need to programatically bring the system in a particular state, and handles the test-writer a high-level abstraction mechanism to query the trace. The resulting system, called TESTLOG, was used on several real-world case studies to validate our claims.},

Unfortunately, due to the coarse granularity of inheritance, it may be difficult to decompose an application into an optimal class hierarchy that maximizes software reuse. Existing schemes based on single inheritance, multiple inheritance, or mixins, all pose numerous problems for reuse. To overcome these problems we propose traits, pure units of reuse consisting only of methods. We develop a formal model of traits that establishes how traits can be composed, either to form other traits, or to form classes. We also outline an experimental validation in which we apply traits to refactor a non-trivial application into composable units.},

Often, the result of these approaches categorize existing entities into new groups or associates them with mutually exclusive properties. In this paper we present the Distribution Map as a generic technique to visualize and analyze this type of result. Our technique is based on the notion of focus, which shows whether a property is well-encapsulated or cross-cutting, and the notion of spread, which shows whether the property is present in several parts of the system.  We present a basic visualization and complement it with measurements that quantify focus and spread. To validate our technique we show evidence of applying it on the result sets of different analysis approaches. As a conclusion we propose that the Distribution Map technique should belong to any reverse engineering toolkit.},

  abstract = {Although duplicated code is known to pose severe problems for software maintenance, it is difficult to identify in large systems. Many different techniques have been developed to detect software clones, some of which are very sophisticated, but are also expensive to implement and adapt.  Lightweight techniques based on simple string matching are easy to implement, but how effective are they? We present a simple stringbased approach which we have successfully applied to a number of different languages such COBOL, {Java}, C++, Pascal, Python, Smalltalk, C and PDP-11 assembler. In each case the maximum time to adapt the approach to a new language was less than 45 minutes. In this article we investigate a number of simple variants of string-based clone detection that abstract away from common editing operations, and assess the quality of clone detection for very different case studies. Our results confirm that this inexpensive clone detection technique generally achieves high recall and acceptable precision. Over-zealous normalization of the code before comparison, however, can result in unacceptable numbers of false positives.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, many complex applications are built with a web browser as their main user interface. However, despite the increasing popularity of the web as an application platform, implementing and maintaining web applications still remains difficult and lags behind conventional desktop application development.  The underlying technologies such as HTTP for the interaction and XHTML/CSS for the presentation were originally built to display and link static documents. Unfortunately, most mainstream frameworks provide only little abstraction over the page-oriented structure imposed by those technologies. Inevitably, the goto-like manner of how pages are linked leads to spaghetti code and hampers reuse. In this article we present Seaside, a web application framework that provides an uniform and pure object-oriented view on web applications.  In this way, Seaside avoids the unwieldily goto-like style. Exploiting the reflective features of Smalltalk, Seaside reintroduces procedure call abstraction in the client-server context. Seaside's key concepts are: (i) a component architecture supporting multiple, simultaneously active control flows, (ii) a programmatic XHTML generation, and (iii) fully supported on-the-fly debugging, code-editing, and recompilation. In this article we discuss these key features of Seaside and explain how they are made possible by the dynamic nature and the reflective capabilities of Smalltalk.},

  abstract = {A trait is a unit of behaviour that can be composed with other traits and used by classes. Traits offer an alternative to multiple inheritance. Conflict resolution of traits, while flexible, does not completely handle accidental method name conflicts: if a trait with method m is composed with another trait defining a different method m then resolving the conflict may prove delicate or infeasible in cases where both versions of m are still needed. In this paper we present freezable traits, which provide an expressive composition mechanism to support unanticipated method composition conflicts.  Our solution introduces private trait methods and lets the class composer change method visibility at composition time (from public to private and vice versa). Moreover two class composers may use different composition policies for the same trait, something which is not possible in mainstream languages. This approach respects the two main design principles of traits: the class composer is empowered and traits can be flattened away. We present an implementation of freezable traits in Smalltalk. As a side-effect of this implementation we introduced private (early-bound and invisible) methods to Smalltalk by distinguishing object-sends from self-sends. Our implementation uses compile-time bytecode manipulation and, as such, introduces no run-time penalties.},

Packages are important but complex structural entities that may be difficult to understand since they play different development roles (i.e., class containers, code ownership basic structure, architectural elements...). Maintainers of large applications face the problem of understanding how packages are structured in general and how they relate to each others. In this paper, we present a compact visualization, named Package Surface Blueprint, that qualifies the relationships that a package has with its neighbours. A Package Surface Blueprint represents packages around the notion of package surfaces: groups of relationships according to the packages they refer to. We present two specific views one stressing the references made by a package and another showing the inheritance structure of a package. We applied the visualization on two large case studies: ArgoUML and Squeak.},

Moose is an extensive infrastructure for reverse engineering evolved for over 10 years that promotes the reuse of engineering efforts in research. Moose accommodates various types of data modeled in the FAMIX family of meta-models. The goal of this half-day workshop is to strengthen the community of researchers and practitioners who are working in re- and reverse engineering, by providing a forum for building future research starting from Moose and FAMIX as shared infrastructure.},

  abstract = {Single inheritance often forces developers to duplicate code and logic. This widely recognized situation affects both business code and tests. In a large and complex application whose classes implement many groups of methods (protocols), duplication may also follow the application's idiosyncrasies, making it difficult to specify, maintain, and reuse tests. The research questions we faced are (i) how can we reuse test specifications across and within complex inheritance hierarchies, especially in presence of orthogonal protocols; (ii) how can we test interface behavior in a modular way; (iii) how far can we reuse and parametrize composable tests. In this paper, we compose tests out of separately specified behavioral units of reuse ---traits. We propose test traits, where: (i) specific test cases are composed from independent specifications; (ii) executable behavior specifications may be reused orthogonally to the class hierarchy under test; (iii) test fixtures are external to the test specifications, thus are easier to specialize. Traits have been successfully applied to test two large and critical class libraries in Pharo, a new Smalltalk dialect based on Squeak, but are applicable to other languages with traits.}

  abstract = {Traits are method groups that can be used to compose classes. They do not have a runtime existence and are conceptually folded into the classes that use them. Traits have been implemented in different languages. While implementing them in Smalltalk, our first reflex was to take advantage of the fact that traits are not run-time entities: we optimized the implementation for space and hence shared methods between traits and classes. However, by doing so we broke the introspective API of Smalltalk. This paper illustrates a more general problem seen in all reflective systems: the implementation serves both as a model for execution and as the model that is exposed to the programmer. There is a conflict of interests between the information necessary for execution and the information the programmer is interested in. In addition, as soon as the implementation is exposed via reflection, we are not free to optimize. As the complete implementation is visible reflectively, there is no way to hide the optimizations. Few papers report errors and this is one of them. We report our experience facing the initial API mismatch, which has a significant impact on the system because the language is reflective (i.e., written in itself and causally connected). We present the new introspective API we put in place.},

  abstract = {The decomposition of a software application into components and connectors at the design stage has been promoted as a way to describe and reason about complex software architectures. There is, however, surprisingly little language support for this decomposition at implementation level. Interaction relationships which are identified at design time are lost as they get spread out into the participating entities at implementation. In this paper, we propose first-class connectors in an object-oriented language as a first step towards making software architecture more explicit at implementation level. Our connectors are run-time entities which control the interaction of components and can express a rich repertoire of interaction relationships. We show how connectors can be reused and how they enhance the reuse of components.},

  abstract = {Although coordination of multiple activities is a fundamental goal of object-oriented concurrent programming languages, there is only limited support for their specification and abstraction at the language level. This leads to a mismatch between conceptional designs, using high-level abstractions, and the implementation, using the low-level coordination constructs. Often coordination is hard-wired into the components they coordinate, which leads to evolution, maintenance and composibility problems. We propose a model called FLO/C that relies on the notion of connectors. A connector is an entity that enforces the coordination of the entities it coordinates. This model supports a clear separation between the coordinated active objects and their coordination.  An active object only defines specific domain information and a connector only defines coordination between a group of active objects (its participants). The coordination is abstractly defined refering to components in terms of the object interface. Coordination and coordinated entities are independant and can evolve separately.  Coordination can be composed and replaced easily.},

Different techniques exist, from the well known approach based on the specialization of the doesNotUnderstand: method to the exploitation the method lookup algorithm done by the virtual machine. Until now no comparison between these techniques has been made. In this article we compare the different techniques taking into account the reflective aspects used, the scope, the limit and the cost of the control.},

Good tools for detecting duplicated code are scarce because of the large amount of data to be checked, because duplicated code is not known a priori and because especially it requires parsing technology. In this paper we show that is possible to circumvent these complicating factors by applying a language independent and lightweigth approach, i.e. a tool that requires no parsing and a little learning and configuration time, yet is able to detect a significant amount of code duplication. We validate our approach on a number of case studies, involving five different implementation languages and ranging from 256 K up untill 26Mb of source code.},

  abstract = {In reengineering an object-oriented system we want to benefit from the expertise developed in earlier efforts. It is therefore essential to have a way to communicate expertise at different levels: from knowledge about how to approach a system to be reengineered, to knowledge about improving code by eliminating 'bad' style. In this paper we propose to use a pattern form to communicate knowledge about reengineering. A reengineering pattern connects an observable problem in the code to a reengineering goal: it describes the process of going from the existing legacy solution causing or aggravating the problem to a new refactored solution which meets the reengineering goal. It thus gives a method appropriate for a specific problem, rather than proposing a general methodology, and makes reference to the appropriate tools or techniques for obtaining the refactored solution. In this paper we discuss the role of reengineering patterns and contrast them with related kinds of patterns. We then highlight the form of reengineering patterns and present two simple patterns for type-check elimination.},

  abstract = {Although unit testing is essential for programming, current languages only barely support the developer in composing unit tests into new ones or in navigating between unit tests and their corresponding methods under test. We have taken several Smalltalk programs and analyzed the relationships between unit tests and methods under test, and the re- lationships amongst unit tests.  First results indicate that most unit tests can be seen or at least decomposed into commands which focus on single methods, and that large portions of unit tests overlap each other. But these relationships between unit tests and methods under test are not reflected in current languages. We therefore first conceptually extend the meta-model of Smalltalk with one-method commands so that unit tests become both com- posable and navigable. Then we introduce a first lightweight implementation of this meta model using method comments to differentiate between the several test phases of existing XUnit test case methods.},

Having the history of the code (i.e., the versions) could be of help if this would not imply analyzing a huge amount of data. In this paper we present an approach for identifying candidate classes for reverse engineering and reengineering efforts. Our solution is based on summarizing the changes in the evolution of object-oriented software systems by defining history measurements. Our approach, named Yesterday`s Weather, is an analysis based on the retrospective empirical observation that classes which changed the most in the recent past also suffer important changes in the near future. We apply this approach on two case studies and show how we can obtain an overview of the evolution of a system and pinpoint its classes that might change in the next versions.},

                  information when reasoning about the systems at hand
                  or when reasoning about general laws of software
                  evolution. Over the past 30 years more and more
                  research has been spent on understanding software
                  evolution. However, the approaches developed so far
                  do not rely on an explicit meta-model, and thus,
                  they make it difficult to reuse or compare their
                  results. We argue that there is a need for an
                  explicit meta-model for software evolution analysis.
                  We present a survey of the evolution analyses and
                  deduce a set of requirements that an evolution
                  meta-model should have. We define, Hismo, a
                  meta-model in which history is modeled as an
                  explicit entity. Hismo adds a time layer on top of
                  structural information, and provides a common
                  infrastructure for expressing and combining
                  evolution analyses and structural analyses. We
                  validate the usefulness of our a meta-model by

  abstract = {The emerging field of context-oriented programming
                  gives a predominant role to the execution context of
                  applications, and advocates the use of dedicated
                  mechanisms to allow the elegant expression of
                  behavioural adaptations to such context. With
                  suitable reflective facilities, language semantics
                  can be adapted to context by reusing the same
                  context-oriented mechanisms that allow base-level
                  adaptability. This kind of meta-level adaptability,
                  in which the computation model itself becomes
                  adaptable to context, gives rise to context-oriented
                  computational reflection. To explore this idea, we
                  set out to implement a simple software transactional
                  memory system that exploits meta-level adaptability
                  by regarding transactions as contexts, and adapting
                  fundamental system behaviour to such transactional
                  contexts. The implementation is succinct and
                  non-intrusive, giving us an indication of the power
                  lying at the crossroads of context-oriented
                  programming and computational reflection.},

                  that just by reading the source code, it is
                  difficult to determine how classes and methods
                  contribute to the runtime behavior of features.
                  Moreover, dependencies between system features are

                  To tackle these problems, we propose a compact

  abstract = {Features encapsulate the domain knowledge of a
                  software system and thus are valuable sources of
                  information for a reverse engineer. When analyzing
                  the evolution of a system, we need to know how and
                  which features were modified to recover both the
                  change intention and its extent, namely which source
                  artifacts are affected. Typically, the
                  implementation of a feature crosscuts a number of
                  source artifacts. To obtain a mapping between
                  features to the source artifacts, we exercise the
                  features and capture their execution traces. However
                  this results in large traces that are difficult to
                  interpret. To tackle this issue we compact the
                  traces into simple sets of source artifacts that
                  participate in a feature's runtime behavior. We
                  refer to these compacted traces as feature views.
                  Within a feature view, we partition the source
                  artifacts into disjoint sets of characterized
                  software entities. The characterization defines the
                  level of participation of a source entity in the
                  features. We then analyze the features over several
                  versions of a system and we plot their evolution to
                  reveal how and hich features were affected by
                  changes in the code. We show the usefulness of our
                  approach by applying it to a case study where we
                  address the problem of merging parallel development
                  tracks of the same system.},

  abstract = {Software systems are typically developed by teams of
                  developers, with responsibilities for different
                  parts of the code. Knowledge of how the developers
                  collaborate, and how their responsibilities are
                  distributed over the software artifacts is a
                  valuable source of information when reverse
                  engineering a system. Determining which developers
                  are responsible for which software artifacts (\eg
                  packages or classes) is just one perspective. In
                  this paper we complement the static perspective with
                  the dynamic perspective of a system in terms of its
                  features. We want to extract information about which
                  developers are responsible for which features. To
                  achieve these two perspectives, we correlate
                  developer responsibilities both with a structural
                  view of the system and with a feature view. We
                  identify which developers are responsible for which
                  features, and whether the responsibilities
                  correspond with structural source code artifacts or

  abstract = {Meta programming is the act of reasoning about a
                  computational system. For example, a program in
                  Prolog can reason about a program written in
                  Smalltalk. Reflection is a more powerful form of
                  meta programming where the same language is used to
                  reason about, and act upon, itself in a causally
                  connected way. Thus on the one hand we have meta
                  programming that allows different languages or
                  paradigms to be used, but without causal connection,
                  while on the other hand we have reflection that
                  offers causal connection but only for a single
                  language. This paper combines both and presents
                  inter-language reflection that allows one language
                  to reason about and change in a causally connected
                  way another language and vice versa. The fundamental
                  aspects of inter-language reflection and the
                  language symbiosis used therein, are discussed.
                  Moreover the implementation of two symbiotic
                  reflective languages is discussed: Agora/Java and

                  with type annotations before any type-checking can
                  be performed. We propose a practical and pragmatic
                  approach to introduce pluggable type systems to
                  dynamic languages. First of all, only annotated code
                  is type-checked. Second, limited type inference is
                  performed on unannotated code to reduce the number
                  of reported errors. Finally, external annotations
                  can be used to type third-party code. We present
                  Typeplug, a Smalltalk implementation of our
                  framework, and report on experience applying the
                  framework to three different pluggable type
                  systems.},

  abstract = {Understanding a software system by just analyzing
                  the structure of the system reveals only half of the
                  picture, since the structure tells us only how the
                  code is working but not what the code is about. What
                  the code is about can be found in the semantics of
                  the source code: names of identifiers, comments etc.
                  In this paper, we analyze how these terms are spread
                  over the source artifacts using Latent Semantic
                  Indexing, an information retrieval technique. We use
                  the assumption that parts of the system that use
                  similar terms are related. We cluster artifacts that
                  use similar terms, and we reveal the most relevant
                  terms for the computed clusters. Our approach works
                  at the level of the source code which makes it
                  language independent. Nevertheless, we correlated
                  the semantics with structural information and we
                  applied it at different levels of abstraction (e.g.
                  classes, methods). We applied our approach on three

                  Comprehension focus on program program structure or
                  external documentation. However, by analyzing formal
                  information the informal semantics contained in the
                  vocabulary of source code are overlooked. To
                  understand software as a whole, we need to enrich
                  software analysis with the developer knowledge
                  hidden in the code naming. This paper proposes the
                  use of information retrieval to exploit linguistic
                  information found in source code, such as identifier
                  names and comments. We introduce Semantic
                  Clustering, a technique based on Latent Semantic
                  Indexing and clustering to group source artifacts
                  that use similar vocabulary. We call these groups
                  semantic clusters and we interpret them as
                  linguistic topics that reveal the intention of the
                  code. We compare the topics to each other, identify
                  links between them, provide automatically retrieved
                  labels, and use a visualization to illustrate how
                  they are distributed over the system. Our approach
                  is language independent as it works at the level of
                  identifier names. To validate our approach we

  abstract = {Web development has moved from simple static pages to complex web applications, some of them
resembling desktop ones. In most of these applications the web browser acts as thin-client (or a view) of the
model that sits on the server. Despite the technological evolution of the web, there is still no standard
mechanism to send data or events from the server to the client without an explicit request from the later,
thus forcing the web browser to constantly poll the server for updates. To solve this problem a set of
techniques under the name of Comet were proposed, allowing to send information from the server to the web
browser without an explicit client request. In this paper we introduce Meteoroid, a Comet approach to make
live Seaside applications. Our framework exploits the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm for building
 simple yet scalable web applications, requiring very little programming effort.},

A change can be ef- fected by applying a tool to the source code, or by a manual refac- toring. In addition, tools run over a model are costly to redevelop. It raises an interesting challenge for tools implementors: how to support modification of large source code models to enable com- parison of multiple versions. One naive approach is to copy the entire model after each modification. However, such an approach is too expensive in memory and execution time. In this paper we ex- plore different implementations that source code metamodels sup- port multiple versions of a system. We propose a solution based on dynamic binding of entities between multiple versions, providing good access performance while minimizing memory consumption.},

  abstract = {Dependency Structure Matrix (DSM) has been successfully applied to identify software
 dependencies among packages and subsystems. A number of algorithms were proposed to compute the
 matrix so that it highlights patterns and problematic dependencies between subsystems. However,
 existing DSM implementations often miss important information to fully support reengineering
 effort. For example, they do not clearly qualify and quantify problematic relationships,
 information which is crucial to support remediation tasks.
In this paper we present enriched DSM (eDSM) where cells are enriched with contextual information
 about (i) the type of dependencies (inheritance, class reference . . . ), (ii) the proportion of
 referencing entities, (iii) the proportion of referenced entities. We distinguish independent
 cycles and stress potentially simple fixes for cycles using coloring information. This work is
 language independent and has been implemented on top of the Moose reengineering environment. It has
 been applied to non-trivial case studies among which ArgoUML, and Morphic the UI framework

  abstract = {When reengineering software systems, maintainers should be able to assess and compare multiple change scenarios for a given goal, so as to choose the most pertinent one. Because they implicitly consider one single working copy, revision control systems do not scale up well to perform simultaneous analyses of multiple versions of systems. We designed Orion, an interactive prototyping tool for reengineering, to simulate changes and compare their impact on multiple versions of software source code models. Our approach offers an interactive simulation of changes, reuses existing assessment tools, and has the ability to hold multiple and branching versions simultaneously in memory. Specifically, we devise an infrastructure which optimizes memory usage of multiple versions for large models. This infrastructure uses an extension of the FAMIX source code meta-model but it is not limited to source code analysis tools since it can be applied to models in general. In this paper, we validate our approach by running benchmarks on memory usage and computation time of model queries on large models. Our benchmarks show that the Orion approach scales up well in terms of memory usage, while the current implementation could be optimized to lower its computation time. We also report on two large case studies on which we applied Orion.},

                  method bodies. In languages that support traits,
                  classes are composed out of traits. There are two
                  main advantages with traits. Firstly, decomposing
                  existing classes into traits from which they can be
                  recomposed improves the factoring of hierarchies.
                  Secondly it increases the library reuse potential by
                  providing more reusable traits. Identifying traits
                  and decomposing class hierarchies into traits is
                  therefore an important and challenging task to
                  facilitate maintainability and evolution. In this
                  paper we present how we use Formal Concept Analysis
                  to identify traits in inheritance hierarchies. Our
                  approach is two-staged: first we identify within a
                  hierarchy maximal groups of methods that have a set
                  of classes in common, second we cluster cohesive
                  groups of methods based on method invocations as
                  potential traits. We applied our approach on two
                  significant hierarchies and compare our results with
                  the manual refactorization of the same code which
                  was done by the authors of traits.},

                  object-orientation understanding program execution
                  by analyzing method traces is complicated because
                  the behavior of a program depends on the sharing and

                  argue that trace-based dynamic analysis is at a too

                  systems. We propose a new approach that captures the
                  life cycle of objects by explicitly taking into
                  account object aliasing and how aliases propagate
                  during the execution of the program. In this paper,

                  runtime execution. Those approaches primarily
                  analyze the control flow by tracing method execution

  abstract = {A large body of research analyzes the runtime
                  execution of a system to extract abstract behavioral
                  views. Those approaches primarily analyze control
                  flow by tracing method execution events or they
                  analyze object graphs of heap snapshots. However,
                  they do not capture how objects are passed through
                  the system at runtime. We refer to the exchange of
                  objects as the object flow, and we claim that object
                  flow is necessary to analyze if we are to understand
                  the runtime of an object-oriented application. We
                  propose and detail Object Flow Analysis, a novel
                  dynamic analysis technique that takes this new
                  information into account. To evaluate its
                  usefulness, we present a visual approach that allows
                  a developer to study classes and components in terms
                  of how they exchange objects at runtime. We
                  illustrate our approach on three case studies.},

  abstract = {Array programming shines in its ability to express
                  computations at a high-level of abstraction,
                  allowing one to manipulate and query whole sets of
                  data at once. This paper presents the OPA model that
                  enhances object-oriented programming with array
                  programming features. The goal of OPA is to
                  determine a minimum set of modifications that must
                  be made to the traditional object model in order to
                  take advantage of the possibilities of array
                  programming. It is based on a minimal extension of
                  method invocation and the definition of a kernel of
                  methods implementing fundamental array programming
                  operations. The OPA model presents a generalization
                  of traditional message passing in the sense that a
                  message can be send to an entire set of objects. The
                  model is validated in FS, a new scripting language.},

                  software systems are built to last, over time they
                  degrade as much as any legacy software system. As a
                  consequence, one must invest in reengineering

                  though software systems and their business contexts

                  developer to manage software change more effectively
                  than is currently possible. Furthermore we argue

  abstract = {Software must be constantly adapted to changing
                  requirements. The time scale, abstraction level and
                  granularity of adaptations may vary from short-term,
                  fine-grained adaptation to long-term, coarse-grained
                  evolution. Fine-grained, dynamic and
                  context-dependent adaptations can be particularly
                  difficult to realize in long-lived, large-scale
                  software systems. We argue that, in order to
                  effectively and efficiently deploy such changes,
                  adaptive applications must be built on an
                  infrastructure that is not just model-driven, but is
                  both model-centric and context-aware. Specifically,
                  this means that high-level, causally-connected
                  models of the application and the software
                  infrastructure itself should be available at
                  run-time, and that changes may need to be scoped to
                  the run-time execution context. We first review the
                  dimensions of software adaptation and evolution, and
                  then we show how model-centric design can address
                  the adaptation needs of a variety of applications
                  that span these dimensions. We demonstrate through
                  concrete examples how model-centric and
                  context-aware designs work at the level of
                  application interface, programming language and
                  runtime. We then propose a research agenda for a
                  model-centric development environment that supports
                  dynamic software adaptation and evolution.},

                  enhanced DSM by adding written and colored information in the

                  architecture is not explicitly represented in the
                  code. The second problem is that successful
                  applications evolve over time, so their architecture
                  inevitably drifts. Reconstructing the architecture
                  and checking whether it is still valid is therefore
                  an important aid. While there is a plethora of
                  approaches and techniques supporting architecture
                  reconstruction, there is no comprehensive state of
                  the art and it is often difficult to compare the
                  approaches. This article presents a state of the art
                  on software architecture reconstruction approaches.},

                  define measurements which summarize how persistent

                  that the system is behaving as expected. Not only do
                  tests ensure correctness, but they also offer a live
                  documentation for the code. However, as the system
                  evolves, the tests need to evolve as well to keep up
                  with the system, and as the test suite grows larger,
                  the effort invested into maintaining tests is a
                  significant activity. In this context, the quality
                  of tests becomes an important issue, as developers

  abstract = {Model-driven engineering is a powerful approach to
                  build large-scale applications. However, an
                  application's metamodel often remains static after
                  the development phase and cannot be changed unless a
                  new development effort occurs. Yet, end users often
                  need to rapidly adapt their applications to new
                  business needs. In many cases, the end users would
                  know how to make the required adaptations, if only,
                  the application would let them do so. In this paper
                  we present how we built a runtime-dynamic
                  meta-environment by integrating Magritte, a
                  self-described metamodel, into Smalltalk's
                  reflective language model. Our solution offers the
                  best of both worlds: developers can develop their
                  applications using the same tools they were used to,
                  but at the same time they gain the power of
                  meta-programming. We show in particular that our
                  approach is adapted to support end user
                  customization of applications: the adaptive model of
                  Magritte enables to not only describe existing
                  classes, but also lets end users build their own
                  metamodels on the fly.},

                  widespread acceptance, pressure is increasing for
                  the development of new domain-specific languages.
                  Unfortunately these DSLs typically conflict with the
                  grammar of the host language, making it difficult to
                  compose hybrid code except at the level of strings;
                  few mechanisms (if any) exist to control the scope
                  of usage of multiple DSLs; and, most seriously,
                  existing host language tools are typically unaware
                  of the DSL extensions, thus hampering the
                  development process. Language boxes address these
                  issues by offering a simple, modular mechanism to
                  encapsulate (i) compositional changes to the host
                  language, (ii) transformations to address various
                  concerns such as compilation and highlighting, and
                  (iii) scoping rules to control visibility of
                  language extensions. We describe the design and
                  implementation of language boxes, and show with the
                  help of several examples how modular extensions can
                  be introduced to a host language and environment.},

                  best practices for a particular programming
                  language. The proliferation of internal
                  domain-specific languages and models, however, poses
                  new challenges for such tools. Traditional program
                  checkers produce many false positives and fail to
                  accurately check constraints, best practices, common
                  errors, possible optimizations and portability
                  issues particular to domain-specific languages. We
                  advocate the use of dedicated rules to check
                  domain-specific practices. We demonstrate the
                  implementation of domain-specific rules, the
                  automatic fixing of violations, and their
                  application to two case-studies: (1) Seaside defines
                  several internal DSLs through a creative use of the
                  syntax of the host language; and (2) Magritte adds
                  meta-descriptions to existing code by means of
                  special methods. Our empirical validation
                  demonstrates that domain-specific program checking

                  level, making it hard to maintain and evolve an e
                  xisting software application. The extraction of
                  collaborations from code is therefore an important

                  an iterative approach which uses dynamic information
                  to support the recovery and understanding of collabo
                  rations. We describe a tool we have developed to
                  support our approach and demonstrate its use on a
                  case study.},

                  development and maintenance of large software
                  systems. The detection and removal of duplicated
                  code has become a standard activity during the
                  refactoring phases of a software life-cycle.
                  However, code duplication identification ends to
                  produce large amounts of data making the
                  understanding of the duplication situation as a
                  whole difficult. Reengineers can easily lose sight
                  of the forest for the trees. There is a need to
                  support a qualitative analysis of the duplicated
                  code. In this paper we propose a number of
                  visualzations of duplicated source elements that
                  support reengineers in answering questions, e.g.,
                  which parts of the sysem are connected by copied

                  applications are built, while methods contain the
                  actual program logic. The main problem of this task
                  is to quickly grasp the purpose and inner structure

    Change prediction helps developers by recommending program entities that will have to be changed alongside the entities currently
    being changed. To evaluate their accuracy, current change prediction approaches use data from versioning systems such as CVS or SVN.
    These data sources provide a coarse-grained view of the development history that flattens the sequence of changes in a single commit.
    They are thus not a valid basis for evaluation in the case of developmentstyle prediction, where the order of the predictions has to
    match the order of the changes a developer makes.
    We propose a benchmark for the evaluation of change prediction approaches based on fine-grained change data recorded from IDE usage.
    Moreover, the change prediction approaches themselves can use the more accurate data to fine-tune their prediction. We present an
    evaluation procedure and use it on several change prediction approaches, both novel and from the literature, and report on the
    results.},

  title = {Tackling Software Navigation Issues of the Smalltalk IDE},
  abstract = {The IDE used in most Smalltalk dialects such as Pharo, Squeak or Cincom Smalltalk did not evolve
  			significantly over the last years, if not to say decades. For other languages, for instance Java, the
			available IDEs made tremendous progress as Eclipse or NetBeans illustrate. While the Smalltalk
			IDE served as an exemplar for many years, other IDEs caught up or even overtook the erstwhile
			leader in terms of feature-richness, usability, or code navigation facilities.
			In this paper we first analyze the difficulty of software navigation in the Smalltalk IDE and second
			illustrate with concrete examples the features we added to the Smalltalk IDE to fill the gap to
			modern IDEs and to provide novel, improved means to navigate source space. We show that
			thanks to the agility and dynamics of Smalltalk, we are able to extend and enhance with reasonable
			effort the Smalltalk IDE to better support software navigation, program comprehension, and software
			maintenance in general. One such support is the integration of dynamic information into the static
			source views we are familiar with. Other means include easing the access to static information
			(for instance by better arranging important packages) or helping developers re-locating artifacts
			of interest (for example with a categorization system such as smart groups).},

  title = {Autumn Leaves: Curing the Window Plague in IDEs},
  abstract = {Navigating large software systems is difficult as the various artifacts are distributed in a huge space, while the relationships between different artifacts often remain hidden and obscure. As a consequence, developers using a modern interactive development environment (IDE) are forced to open views on numerous source artifacts to reveal these hidden relationships, leading to a crowded workspace with many opened windows or tabs. Developers often lose the overview in such a cluttered workspace as IDEs provide little support to get rid of unused windows. AutumnLeaves automatically selects windows unlikely for future use to be closed or grayed out while important ones are displayed more prominently. This reduces the number of windows opened at a time and adds structure to the developer's workspace. We validate AutumnLeaves with a benchmark evaluation using recorded navigation data of various developers to determine the prediction quality of the employed algorithms.},

  abstract = {The concept of interfaces is central to
                  object-oriented methodologies and is one of the most
                  attractive features of {Java} and COM. Although
                  Smalltalk always had interfaces implicitly, in
                  Smalltalk interfaces are not first-class objects: t
                  hey cannot be conversed with, referred to, or
                  reflected upon. Consequently, Smalltalkers have been
                  deprived of such an important and useful tool. Since
                  a fundamental feature of Smalltalk is that just
                  about everything in the language is an
                  implementation feature, explicit, static interfaces
                  can be added to Smalltalk using Smalltalk itself
                  with ease. However, such an addition would
                  short-change the powerful dynamic aspects of
                  Smalltalk. In this article we present
                  SmallInterfaces; a new ontology of dynamic i
                  nterfaces which makes a powerful use of the dynamic
                  nature of Smalltalk. SmallInterfaces adds interfaces
                  as honorary members to Smalltalk's extensive
                  reflection mechanism, in a manner portable across
                  the many Smalltalk variants},

                  Traits are essentially groups of methods that serve

                  where feature-sharing cannot be linearized.
                  Multiple-inheritance and mixins alleviate this
                  problem, but lead to other difficulties in the face

                  Traits solve both problems by factoring out shared

                  object-oriented programming, it is surprising to
                  note that mainstream object-oriented languages offer
                  only limited and fixed ways of encapsulating
                  methods. Typically one may only address two
                  categories of clients, users and heirs, and one must
                  bind visibility and access rights at an early stage.
                  This can lead to inflexible and fragile code as well
                  as clumsy workarounds. We propose a simple and
                  general solution to this problem in which
                  encapsulation policies can be specified separately
                  from implementations. As such they become
                  first-class composable entities that can be reused
                  by different classes. We present a detailed analysis

                  traditionally been based on static type systems. As
                  a consequence, dynamically-typed languages have only
                  limited support for encapsulation. This is
                  surprising, considering that encapsulation is one of
                  the most fundamental and important concepts behind
                  object-oriented programming and that it is essential
                  for writing programs that are maintainable and
                  reliable, and that remain robust as they evolve. In
                  this paper we describe the problems that are caused
                  by insufficient encapsulation mechanisms and then
                  present object-oriented encapsulation, a simple and

                  also describe an implementation of object-oriented
                  encapsulation in Smalltalk. Benchmarks show that
                  extensive use of objectoriented encapsulation

  abstract = {Context-aware applications behave differently
                  depending on the context in which they are running.
                  Since context-specific behavior tends to crosscut
                  base programs, it can advantageously be implemented
                  as aspects. This leads to the notion of
                  context-aware aspects, e.g., aspects whose behavior
                  depends on context. This paper analyzes the issue of
                  appropriate support from the aspect language to both
                  restrict the scope of aspects according to the
                  context and allow aspect definitions to access
                  information associated to the context. We propose an
                  open framework for context-aware aspects that allows
                  for the definition of first-class contexts and
                  supports the definition of context awareness
                  constructs for aspects, including the ability to
                  refer to past contexts, and to provide domain- and
                  application-specific constructs.},

  abstract = {Refactoring --- transforming code while preserving
                  behaviour --- is currently considered a key approach
                  for improving object-oriented software systems.
                  Unfortunately, all of the current refactoring tools
                  depend on language-dependent refactoring engines,
                  which prevents a smooth integration with mainstream
                  development environments. In this paper we
                  investigate the similarities between refactorings
                  for Smalltalk and {Java}, derive a
                  language-independent meta-model and show that it is
                  feasible to build a language-independent refactoring
                  engine on top of this meta-model. Our feasibility
                  study is validated by means of a tool prototype
                  which uses the same engine to refactor both
                  Smalltalk and {Java} code. Using our approach we
                  minimize the language-dependent part of refactoring
                  tools, providing a standard way for programmers and
                  tools to perform refactorings no matter what

However, there is little support to help release masters (integrators) to take decisions about the integration of published merged changes into the system release. Most of the time, the release master has to read all the changed code, check the diffs to build an idea of a change, and read unchanged code to understand the context of some changes. Such a task can be overwhelming. In this paper we present a dashboard to support integrators getting an overview of proposed changes in the context of object-oriented programming. Our approach named Torch characterizes changes based on structural information, authors and symbolic information. It mixes text-based diff information with visual representation and metrics characterizing the changes. We describe our experiment applying it to Pharo, a large open-source system, and report on the evaluation of our approach by release masters of several open-source projects.},

  abstract = {Meta-programming is the act of using one system or
                  language to reason about another one. Reflection
                  describes systems that have access to and change a
                  causally connected representation of themselves,
                  hence leading to self-extensible systems . Up to
                  now, most of the reflective languages have been
                  implemented in the same paradigm. In this paper, we
                  propose \emph{symbiotic reflection} as a way to
                  integrate a meta programming language with the
                  object-oriented language it reasons about and is
                  implemented in. New to this approach is that any
                  element of the implementation language can be
                  reasoned about and acted upon (not only the self
                  representation), and that both languages are of
                  different paradigms. Moreover, every language
                  implementer that is faced with the problem of
                  allowing the base language to access the underlying
                  meta-language has to solve the problem of enabling
                  entity transfer between both worlds. We propose a

                  problem that avoid explicit wrapping or
                  typechecking. We illustrate this with SOUL (the
                  Smalltalk Open Unification Language), a logic
                  programming language in symbiotic reflection with
                  the object-oriented language Smalltalk. We show how
                  SOUL does logic reasoning directly on Smalltalk
                  objects, and how to use this to implement type
                  snooping},

                  came to be, only to be surpassed by object-oriented

                  spawns lots of specialised tools to edit code,
                  employ UML schemes, integrate documentation, and so
                  on. The problem is that the tool builders themselves
                  are responsible for making their tools interoperable
                  with other tools or development environments.
                  Because they cannot anticipate all other tools they
                  can integrate with, a lot of tools cannot
                  co-operate. This paper introduces the classication
                  model, a lightweight integration medium that enables
                  unrelated tools that were not meant to be integrated
                  to cooperate easily. Moreover, the tool integration
                  is done by a tool integrator, and not by the tool
                  builder. To validate this claim, we show how to
                  integrate several third-party tools using the
                  classication model, and how it forms the foundation

                  requirements, small memory footprints, and low power
                  consumption. It is usually implemented using

  abstract = {Most of the current garbage collector implementations work by reachability. This means they only take care of the objects that nobody else points to. As a consequence, there are objects which are not really used but are not garbage collected because they are still referenced. Such unused but reachable objects create memory leaks. This is a problem because applications use much more memory than what is actually needed. In addition, they may get slower and crash. It is important to understand which parts of the system are instantiated but also which are used or unused. There is a plethora of work on runtime information or class instantiation visualizations but none of them show whether instances are actually used. Such information is important to identify memory leaks.
In this paper, we present some visualizations that show used/unused objects in object-oriented applications. For this, we use Distribution Map which is a visualization showing spread and focus of properties across systems. We extend Distribution Maps to represent the way classes are used or not, since we distinguish between a class that just has instances from one that has used instances. To identify unused objects, we modified the Pharo Virtual Machine.},

  title = {Experiments with a Fast Object Swapper},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {In object-oriented systems, runtime memory is composed of an object graph in which objects refer to other objects. This graph of objects evolves while the system is running. Graph exporting and swapping are two important object graph operations. Exporting refers to copying the graph to some other memory so that it can be loaded by another system. Swapping refers to moving the graph to a secondary memory (e.g., a hard disk) to temporary release part of the primary memory.
While exporting and swapping are achieved in different ways, each of them faces a common and central problem which is the speed of the approach in presence of large object graphs. Nevertheless, most of the existing solutions do not address well this issue. Another challenge is to deal with extremely common situations where objects outside the exported/swapped graph point to objects inside the graph. To correctly load back an exported subgraph, it is necessary to compute and export extra information that is not explicit in the object subgraph. This extra information is needed because certain objects may require to be reinitialized or recreated, to run specific code before or after the loading, to be updated to a new class definition, etc.
In this paper, we present most of the general problems of object exporting and swapping. As a case of study, we present an analysis of ImageSegment, a fast solution to export and swap object graphs, developed by Dan Ingalls. ImageSegment addresses the speed problems in an efficient way, as shown by the results of several benchmarks we have conducted using Pharo Smalltalk. However, ImageSegment is not a panacea since it still has other problems that hampers its general use.},

  abstract = {Source code management systems record different versions of code. Tool support can then com- pute deltas between versions. However there is little support to be able to perform history-wide queries and analysis: for example building slices of changes and identifying their differences since the beginning of the project. We believe that this is due to the lack of a powerful code meta- model as well as an infrastructure. For example, in Smalltalk often several source code meta- models coexist: the Smalltalk reflective API coexists with the one of the Refactoring engine or distributed versioning system. While having specific meta-models is an engineered solution, it hampers meta-models manipulation as it requires more maintenance efforts (e.g., duplication of tests, transformation between models), and more importantly navigation tool reuse. As a first step to solve this problem, this article presents several source code models that could be used to support several activities and proposes an unified and layered approach to be the foundation for building an infrastructure for omnipresent version browsing.},
